            <h1>About Ted Lasso</h1>
            <p>Created by Jason Sudeikas, Bill Lawrence, Joe Kelly, and Brendon Hunt, Ted Lasso is a comedy series by Apple TV about an American college football coach (Ted Lasso) who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in London, without knowing virtually anything about the sport.</p>

            <p>The idea for the show came from a series of commercials Sudeikas was hired to make for NBC Sports with a similar premise. It was renewed for two more seasons five days after its premiere.</p>

            <p>Ted Lasso recently won 5 awards, and is nominated for 3 more.</p>
