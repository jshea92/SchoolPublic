            <h1>Welcome to F.C. Richmond</h1>
            <p>Ted Lasso is a comedy series by Apple TV about an American college football coach (Ted Lasso) who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in London, without knowing virtually anything about the sport. It is a heartwarming show that focuses more on character development than the sport at hand (or foot).</p>

            <p>What makes Ted Lasso unique is the way it subverts T.V. tropes in a way that's fun and interesting, situations lead to unexpected outcomes that are often delightful.</p>
